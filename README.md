# NLP-Text-Generation-Project
Using a Markov Model and LSTM Neural Network to generate text

## Step 1
Chose an NLP problem, not restricted to the following:
* Reconstruction
* Document Classification
* Token Classification
* Language Modeling
* Machine Translation

  ## Step 2
  Identify or construct a solution based on a *generative* probabilistic language model. Describe the model in detail and
  develop a solution using parameter inference (and/or decoding).

  ## Step 3
 Identify or construct a solution based on a *discriminative* neural network. Describe the network structure in detail and
  develop a solution using parameter inference (and/or decoding).

  ## Step 4
  Train and apply both approaches to *real* data acquired legally. Evaluate the results qualitatively and quantitatively.
  Highlight situations where each approach performs well or poorly. Any unusual/unexpected results require explanation.

  ## Step 5
Train and apply both approaches to *synthetic* data acquired legally. Evaluate the results qualitatively and quantitatively.
Highlight situations where each approach performs well or poorly. Any unusual/unexpected results require explanation.

## Step 6 
Discuss pros and cons of the two approaches. Consider:
* quality/correctness
* data, time, and computational requirements
* interpretability
